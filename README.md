### April 1, 2024 Release notes
(GPG= GeneralPandaGenerator)*\
The **updated version of GPG for Steam** now treats C&C Kane's Wrath differently than the other three games, **preserving backward compatibility for all C&C installations!**

Once you select C&C KW for a key injection, GPG takes the following actions:
1. Resets the registry key permissions so it can be edited in case it's locked, or GPG2.0 was previously used,
2. Injects a unique and awesome, randomly generated serial key,
3. Changes the key's permissions to read-only, thus Kane's Wrath cannot change it every time you run the game!

### How to use GPG2.0
### Before running the program 
**make sure that the game you want to fix isn't running!!!**

#### Step 1
**Run *GeneralPandaGenerator2.0* as an administrator!!!**\
It will then open up!\

#### Step 2

#### Step 3
**Press the button of that game!!!**\
The program will take over! You will have immediate results! No matter the outcome, the button and its checkbox will become inoperable!

#### If everything went well..
you will get a green button and your freshly injected key on the program's list!\

#### 21/10/2022 UPDATE!! PLEASE READ!!
**After noticing that many people needed these scripts, I created a safe, simple, and tiny program that does better than the bland scripts!**

*The difference?*
- *GeneralPandaGenerator* is funnier,
- Generates fresh random 20 characters long alphanumeric keys, every time it's run - meaning the variety of the keys is endless,
- lets you know if the job was done correctly with colored buttons and messages,
- the whole process is three steps!

Hopefully  *GeneralPandaGenerator* will suit you better. You can share it easily with friends via flash drives, without fear of using the same key as could happen with the scripts below!

If you still prefer the scripts, their old Readme test is below:

## Old Readme :)
So what these thingies do is change the game's key on your computer's registry. That way you stop sharing the same key with a friend you want to play with, and the error goes away! The original key is replaced but can be re-obtained by reinstalling the game. It's completely safe!

*"The changes take place by just running one of these files anywhere on your PC."*\
*Tested on these games installed by Origin. Steam or CDs may store the original keys elsewhere. Contact me on Twitter if you keep encountering the error.*

I added 10 keys so up to 10 different people (machines) can use them in case there's a big game.

Steps:
- Close the game before running the file.
- Run only one key file by double-left clicking on it and do NOT use the same file with a friend (different PC).  You'll get the same error again. 
- Agree to everything they want to change and you're ready to go.

There are no infected files. Use them freely.

Have fun, Generals! :D

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and run *(f.e)* "C&CKW1.reg".
