# CommandAndConquerKeyFix
Command & Conquer Tiberium Wars & Kane's Wrath "Serial Key Already in Use" Fix\
*(should add Generals & Zero Hour)*
---
I added 10 keys so up to 10 different people can use them in case there's a big local game.

- Close the game before running the file.
- Use only one key by running a file and do NOT use the same file with a friend.
- The changes take place by just running one of these files anywhere in your PC.
- There are no infected files. Use them freely. Agree to everything they want to change and you're ready to go.

Have fun! :D
