# CommandAndConquerKeyFix
Command & Conquer "Serial Key Already in Use" Fix
---
fixes for:
- C&C **Generals**
- C&C **Zero Hour**
- C&C **Tiberium Wars**
- C&C **Kane's Wrath**

*"The changes take place by just running one of these files anywhere on your PC."*\
*Tested on these games installed by Origin. Steam or CDs may store the original keys elsewhere. Contact me on Twitter if you keep encountering the error.*


So what these thingies do is, they change the game's key on your computer's registry. That way you stop sharing the same key with a friend you want to play with, and the error goes away! The original key is replaced, but can be re-obtained by reinstalling the game. It's completely safe!

I added 10 keys so up to 10 different people (machines) can use them in case there's a big game.

Steps:
- Close the game before running the file.
- Run only one key file by double-left clicking on it and do NOT use the same file with a friend (different PC).  You'll get the same error again. 
- Agree to everything they want to change and you're ready to go.

There are no infected files. Use them freely.

Have fun, Generals! :D

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and run *(f.e)* "C&CKW1.reg".
